Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models. These models enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering, computer vision, and recommendation systems.
