Machine learning represents a branch of artificial intelligence that emphasizes the creation of algorithms and statistical models. These models allow computers to complete tasks without explicit programming, depending on patterns and inference. Machine learning techniques find applications in numerous domains, including email spam detection, image recognition, and content recommendation engines.
